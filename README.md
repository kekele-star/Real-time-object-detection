# Real Time Sign Language Detection with TensorFlow Object Detection and Python

This project focuses on implementing real-time sign language detection using TensorFlow Object Detection and Python. The system aims to recognize and interpret sign language gestures through the following steps:

## Overview

- **Dataset**: Utilizes a comprehensive sign language dataset, such as [XYZ Dataset].
- **Model**: Implements a Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) architecture using TensorFlow.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Utilizes the trained model to perform real-time sign language detection through a webcam or video feed.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provides a user-friendly interface for live detection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- [Additional libraries]

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kekele-star/sign-language-detection.git
cd sign-language-detection
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure the dataset is properly organized and preprocessed.
2. **Training**: Train the SSD model using the provided dataset or your custom dataset.
3. **Real-Time Detection**:
   - Run the live detection script:
     ```bash
     python real_time_detection.py
     ```
   - Follow the on-screen instructions for capturing video input and initiating detection.

## Folder Structure

- `/data`: Contains dataset or links to the dataset used for training.
- `/models`: Stores the trained SSD model.
- `/scripts`: Includes Python scripts for training and real-time detection.
- `/utils`: Additional utility scripts or modules.
